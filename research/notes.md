**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed verbally
**Duration**: [20 minutes]

### Q1: Last time you used a task manager or to-do list of any kind
**Response**: "I have never used a task manager before. I usually map out what I need to do in my head"

### Q2:Why have you never used a task manager or to-do list of any kind
**Response**: "I sometimes use notes on my phone but in general I think it is too simple a problem to rely on tools to remember things plus im too lazy. When I have tried to in the past I found it tedious to find the relevant tasks"

**Observations**:
- said too lazy (time consuming to use)
- overly independent 
- difficult to access tasks (not easy to use)

### Q3: What would make you start using a task manager or to-do list
**Response**:"Undertaking a super compex role that requires lots of moving parts. If the task manager had a feature where you could organise them by imprtance or urgency levels."

### Q4: Why is the notes app appealing to you?
**Response**: "It's easily accesible first of all, it's on your phone innit and easy to use, thats about it. It's not fille with a bunch of extra things like notion"

**Observations**:
- acessability and immediacy are motivators
- simplicity matters over features(easy to use)
- quick to create tasks and view them(fast and accesible )

**Themes**: `accesible', 'easy to use', 'organised simply and clean'

---

### Q5: If there was one key feature you would want to add what would it be?
**Response**: "A priority list where I can order tasks by importance level."

**Observations**:
- tasks need to be ranked
- important tasks should never be able to be missed

**Themes**: 'importance ranking', 'notification', 'immediacy'
---

### Q4: What would your device of choice and why?
**Response**: "I would use a laptop as I would only need it for complex matters which I would most likely be using my laptop for. I also need to be portable so laptop over PC."

**Observations**:
- Want features to be usable on a trackpad
- Able to update tasks while on the move

**Themes**: 'easy task updates', 'obvious what everything does'

---

### Q5: Eyes closed / bright sunlight?
**Response**: "Haven't tried eyes closed, but in sunlight I can't read low-contrast text. I increase zoom but then the layout breaks."

---

## Summary (Participant A)
**Top pain points**:
1. Task managers are too time consuming to use
2. difficult to find or access tasks
3. too many features and is not simple enough(too cluttered)
4. clear organisation is needed. Don't ever want to be confused with what is happening or what a button does.
